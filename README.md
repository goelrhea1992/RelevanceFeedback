Description:
	Run the program by typing the following in your terminal...
	
	python BingSearch.py [accountKey] [precision] ['query']

	[accountKey] the bing account key you wish to reference
	[precision] the desired target precision for the query results
	['query'] a single word starting query

Internal Design:
	Summary: Implementation of Rocchio's algorithm using term-frequency, tf-idf, or ntf-idf 
	as the word/document scoring method. 
	Description:
	The user enters a bing account key, desired precision, and a single-word query.
	This triggers a loop which queries bing, displays the results, 
	request user feedback on the relevance of each document, computes a new query, 
	and repeats until the desired precision is reached. 
	The new query computed by Rocchio's algorithm using constants alpha=1, 
	beta=.75, and gamma=.15 as suggested in Manning et. al. 183. 
	The document-word scores are calculated using the tf-idf (term frequency-
	inverse document frequency) method. Tests were also performed using the 
	ntf-idf (maximum normalized term frequency - inverse document frequency)
	explained in eqn 6.15 of Manning et. al. pg. 127. However, this schema did
	not noticibly improve the number of itterations taken to acheive the target 
	precision.
